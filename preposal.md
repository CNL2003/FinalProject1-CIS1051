# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

computational neuroscience : 
code that simulates an action potential using Hodgkin-Huxley equations 

A game where you have to dodge something 

Tic tac toe game against a computer 

code that decides if a person should be admitted into a medical school (given different stats: gpa, mcat score... and based on how many people have already been admitted). Can I code something that each time the code is used and each time a person is accepted, the computer knows that there are only a certain number of seats left? 

A code that takes a data set of reviews from a restaurant and based on the ratings can help new customers decide what to order. (input a menu item, output "yes" or "no") 

A code that doctors can use. Input different symptoms a patient has an output the illness that they have. Also includes error loops for illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and asks the doctor more questions on the patients symptoms. 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?
- does it have to be interactive with the user ?
- Are there any restrictions with what I can do?
- Are we allowed to use online resources to supplement our code? Should we source it if we do?
