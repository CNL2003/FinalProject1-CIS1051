Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done extensive research on machine learning and different applications in medicine and healthcare. I have learn basic knowledge of linear algebra and computational statistics. I also found a lot of data from the website OpenNeuro which is where I plan to get images for my project from. I downloaded all necessary modules through jupyter notebook by utilizing the nilearn user guide and other resources. I also did all example uses on the nilearn user guide over jupyter notebook. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
This week, I hope to utilize all the research I have done and decide what images to use from OpenNeuro. I will then use the examples from the Nilearn user guide to analyze the images and create a predictive model based on machine learning models. If successful, this predictive model will be able to analyze the diseased brains and say what's wrong with the patient and the proper treatment plan. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
I am struggling a bit with the mathematics of machine learning since I am only in Calculus 2. Models of machine learning are very new to me, but I spent a lot of time researching it so if I do some more research, I think I can create a model. Another problem I have encountered is downloading all the required modules. I was getting a lot of errors at first, but after an hour I figured it out.
